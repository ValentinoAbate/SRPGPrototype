General Ideas:
- Make the basic attack transient - (not really working, find some other downside)
- Basic move along path is additive with adjacents.
- Negative space - scales / shapes with biggest adjacent empty space or number of empty spaces
- Heal to full when installed - cannot be uninstalled
- Cannot switch shells while uninstalled
- Moves should cost low AP compared to standard actions? (maybe move base 1, standard base 2)?
- program fusion
- AP goes up after each usage instead of uses per turn - (implemented, seems better)
- Is most of the strategy based not on combining abilities, but situational usefulness? Maybe give the player previews of next encounters like bad north
- Matryoshka enemies that unpack when killed (for area chains)
+ Turrets should be neutral (encounter can end without defeating them, can attack both teams)
- Allow certain multi-actions to be cancellable (multiple part target selection, etc)
- Add enemy-only programs as a specific rarity?
- Have a program that evolves if you finish an encounter in one turn
- Allow the player to run, but only if there are other encounters they could go to, and add penalties. They can't return to the same encounter.
+ Add uninstall all option
- Use free move action as a stat like speed?
- Compile error suppression programs that turn compile errors into compile warnings
+ Move that targets all units with HP equal to current power
- Program whose abilities change based on the colors of the programs adjacent to it. if there is a tie, all are applied. If there are none, grant a special effect
- Program that never reset slowdown but evolves when used for 10 or more AP (maybe a lower cost)
- Action that takes 0 AP and doesn't slowdown quickly, but doesn't use speed and gives you -1 speed
- Link electricity to AP damage? Have grounded ability that lessens it
- Maybe link explosions to fire damage? Or maybe just have it be a damage element
- Action UI should have uses power / uses speed
+ Make differentiation between standard and buff actions
- Boss capacity upgrade that gives +AP but start with -3 power / speed
- Ability that makes chaining hybrid actions free
- Feedback abilities activate after of number of times hit (maybe better with hitting yourself)
- Possibly make each segment 8 long (or just shorter in general)
- Soul core w/ basic move and/or basic attack
- Capacity upgrade w/ basic move and/or basic attack
- Game mode with more units but smaller shells?
- Should give full capacity before soul core likely
+ Encounters have varied map size / shape
- Possibly have less enemies at the start of encounters, with some spawning in later
- Checkers move (keep jumping)
- Ability that triggers when you jump over a unit
- AI could have max moves, max attacks instead of slowdown?
- Shotgun: Attack the get pushed back
- Ability to save a shell at the end of a run to be used against special challenge bosses outside of a run
	- Stars on a shell for beating the different bosses
- Upgrade Ideas
	- Panic Button:
		- C: Teleport next to many enemies, U: SafePanicButton: More likely to teleport to sqaures far away from enemies
		- C: Teleport very far away from your starting square, U: More likely to teleport far away
		- C: Teleport right next to yourself, U: more likely to teleport close
	- Knight's / Rook's / Bishop's Challenge:
		- Find the NPC aqnd it unlocks upgrade to fast move version
	- Ground Pound:
		- Ground Pound+ (+1 damage): Hit 3 targets 3 times
		- Megaton Punch (+1 range): Hit 15 damage with one attack two times ? Hit 4 targets 2 times?
	- Fade:
		- Fadeout: Use while adjacent to at least 3 enemies (extra range)
	- Upgrade Currency? Some weapons cost stuff to upgrade?
- Adjacency Ideas
	- Ricochet (gun/spell) another target within range of the target square is chosen randomly
	- Can be applied to move effects to to have like leaving behind tile effects, etc
- Pawn move / attack that can promote to queen movement
	- Pawn enemy promoted to queen boss
- Hand mode:
	- Programs give multiple copies of actions
	- uses discard / deck hand just like a card game
- Duel puzzles? - Scenarios where you are given a certain program / shell setup and have to clear a board
	- Could involve ice sliding
	- Could involve single-turn clears
- Unique programs: Eggs / seeds (unique programs with mysterious upgrade conditions)
	- When eggs hatch, they give a shell too? (Egg shell)
	- Egg (white) Could hatch into many things -> Egg Shell
	- Golden Egg (Yellow) Sells for a lot, hatches when you have loooots of money -> Golden Shell
	- Silk Egg (Spider egg) -> Silk Shell
	- Flame Egg (Dragon egg) -> Flame Shell
	- Stone Egg (Golem Egg) -> Stone Shell
	- Tortoise Egg (Tortoise Egg) -> Tortoise Shell
	- Sea Egg (Flying Fish Egg) -> Sea Shell
- Roots (Like deities or something)
	- Spider (white) Hidden deity
	- Dragon (red) (related to bombs, fuses)
	- Stone Golem (Blue) (related to stone knights, bishops, etc)
	- Tortoise (Green) (related to to buff / tank enemies)
	- Flying Fish (yellow) (Related to fast enemies) (flying salmon to relate to hybrids?)
- Run bosses are the champions of the roots
	- Spider doesn't have a champion
	- Dragon: Rider
	- Golem: King and Queen
	- Tortoise: Bulwark?
	- Flying Fish: Swift Birdman Joe?
- Special boss / miniboss:
	- Egg Keeper
	- Snake (Egg thief) Steals and eats eggs. Comes after you if you have an egg

Color Mapping:
- Blue (circle): Move actions
- Red (triangle): Attack actions
- Green (square): Support actions
- Yellow (star): Hybrid actions
- White (hexagon / pentagon): Capacity upgrades / actions that have their color set by other means
- Non-action programs may be any color
- Programs that set their colors by external means are usually white regardless of effect
- Shapes added for addional mapping and colorblind accesibility

Shell Capacity:
- Each shell has 3 capacity levels. 
	- When the sum total of the "capacity" values of installed programs reaches reaches certain thresholds, the shell levels up and increases in size by 1 number.
	- There are several different progression paths:
	- Standard: start at size 1. Level 2: 2, Level 3: 5
	- Small: start at size 0. Level 2: 1, Level 3: 4
	- Large: start at size 2. Level 2: 3, Level 3: 6
	- Full: start at size 0. Level 2: 2, Level 3: 4, Level 4: 6, Level 5: 8 
	- Programs that give capacity cannot be uninstalled while uninstalling them would be any currently installed programs illegal
	- Shells expand into the bottom right corner, and then the top left, every other level
- Size 0 shells are 4 x 4, with an average of 08-12 squares open
- Size 1 Shells are 5 x 5, with an average of 14-18 squares open
- Size 2 Shells are 6 x 6, with an average of 24-28 sqaures open
- Size 3 Shells are 7 x 7, with an average of 34-38 squares open
- Size 4 Shells are 8 x 8, with an average of 44-48 squares open

+ AP (min: 0, max: MaxAP) - Recharges to MaxAP at end of turn and end of battle
+ MaxHP (min: 0, max: none) - Recharges to shell level at end of encounter. 0 means you die.
+ HP (min: 0, max: MaxHP)

+ Defense (min: none, max: none) - Subtracted from any damage taken. Get closer to zero after being applied. resets to shell level after an encounter.


Effects: Apply to a pattern
+ Deal [x] damage
- Steal [x] hp
- Steal [x] hp as [stat]
- Steal [stat] as [stat]
+ Deal [x] [stat] damage
	- Deal AP damage equal to enemy speed
+ Reduce [x] AP
- Move to end of [path]
+ Jump / Teleport target
+ Push target
+ Pull Target
+ Swap with target
- Reposition / throw target (requires two-part cancellable actions)
+ Move target towards position (for charge, etc)
+ Add [x] [stat]
- Give free move action - good

Patterns:
- Path [x] tiles (usually move, but could be effect)
- Circle [x] radius
- Square [x] sidelength

Costs: This effect must first be applied to the user to use this action (fails if effect impossible)
- pay [x] [stat]

Attributes: Attributes of a program, common attributes are the program colors
+ Colors
+ Rarities
+ Fixed
+ Action Type (Standard / Move / Hybrid)
+ Transient ([x]) - Destroy after [x] uses or activations
- Corrupted ([time]) - Destroy after time
- Unstable ([trigger]) - Destroy when triggered
- Transforms ([trigger]) - Permanently Change to Unknown program when triggered
- Promotes ([trigger], [time]) - Changes to promoted program effects when triggered (until time has passed)
- Quickdraw - Can only use a the beginning of the turn
- Ambush - Can only be used at the beginning of the battle
- Shatter - destroy after hit for [x] or more damage (pair with defense)

Time: An amount of time
- [x] encounters
- [x] turns

Scopes: a group of programs to which something is applied
- All programs
- All programs of [attribute]
- Adjacent programs
- Non-adjacent programs
- Modified programs

Modifiers: These effects modify other programs in a certain scope (see scope)
- [scope] programs have [x] less/more slowdown/slowdown interval (min/max [y])
- [scope] programs do [x] more/less damage
	- all spells do +1/2(upgrade) base damage, all other weapons deal -1
- [scope] transient programs have [x] more uses. (pair with fixed, unstable - any/all modified programs are destroyed)
	- problably [scope] transient programs use uses from this program instead
- Add [attribute] to [scope] (Fixed, transient, color, etc. pair with fixed)
- Apply cost to [scope] programs
- [scope] blocked cust squares become open. Gains Fixed when a program is installed in any opened slot that isn't also opened from another source
	- [scope] = adjacent
- apply [scope] modifiers to [scope]
	- apply all adajacent modifer effects to adjacent spell weapons

Abilities: These effects give the player special passive abilities
- AP carries over to next turn (pair with -AP gain)
- AP doesn't recharge at the end of the turn (pair with + MaxAP)
- HP fully recharges at the end of the battle (Pair with -MaxHP or maybe half max hp)
	- Your base repair is always equal to your max hp (more interesting)
- Any AP left at the end of the turn is dealt as damage (Pair with positive effect)
- You can go into [x] repair debt (damages you at repair)
- You can go into [x] AP dept (damages you when AP rechanges, maybe subtracts from your next turn)
	- Pair with actions / abilities that get worse with positive AP
- Using the same action more than once in a turn applies [modifier] it
- MaxHP + [x], Unstable HP <= [y]
- When [trigger] gain [ability]/[stat] for [time]
	- When a program is destroyed, gain "All attacks do +1 damage" for 1 encounter
	- Using a hybrid action gives you +1 speed. You cannot install non-hybrid actions
	- Going below [x] hp gives [y] power
- Any transient action that hits more than [x] targets doesn't use a degrade
	- [x] is 2
	- Add Transient 3 + number of fixed transient programs installed
- Apply [effect] when any target is moved
	- Apply def - 1 on any target that is moved
- Gain double/triple repair from repair boxes (maybe just stat gains from stat destroys)

Trigger: Trigger an effect on this condition
- When any/all [scope] programs transform / promote / destroy
- After [x] uses
- When stat is less/greater/equal to [x]
- After an [attribute] program is used
- When an enemy unit is destroyed
- When a unit is destroyed by friendly fire

Action conditions:
- Can only use if moved more/less than [x] tiles
- Can only use if used more/less that [x] different actions this turn
- Can't use any other action this turn

Cust resrictions:
+/- Can't/must put same colors next to each other (Only can't rn)
- Can't have a program that is adjacent to two or more programs of different colors
- Can't/must use [color] color
- Can't use more/less than [x] colors
- Can't use more/less than [x] programs
- Can't use more/less than [x] of [type] of program

Recurring enemies that build shells and have the same macro mechanics as you do:
- Maybe simulate them playing the game, or use other players' data?
- Based on "Rivals" from pokemon
- Procedurally generate / select their goals, and have them be helpful or antagonistic depending on if what the player is doing helps or hinders those goals

Passive:

- Promotion mechanics (Shogi? Look into mini-shogi), maybe macro level upgrades with specific conditions? Maybe micro mid-encounter.
- Maybe look into battleship?
- Maybe have inventory be a limited grid (Nope)

Encounter Design:
- Grid gets bigger after every boss -> 6 x 6 -> 7 x 7 -> 8 x 8 (maybe 5 -> 6 -> 7 to match shells?)
- Encounter based on unit list and number
- Loot /  rewards are generated based on the relative difficulty of encounters
- After second map / boss, gain a second unit
- Make high HP enemies change as turns pass (get stronger / charge up abilities and actions)?

Map Design:
- All events are on a combat grid (even if they do not contain enemies) - most will
	- Think FE rekka no ken
- Loot is visible as battle mystery data (think mmbn6)
	- Mystery data should have two kinds of info: Rarity (frame) and color (type of loot)
	- Like just support / buffs, actions, abilities, or generic
- Special Events (merchant, etc) are NPCs or locations in the map
- Branching map, or maybe just choose next from three (possibly with the ability to scout forward)
- 3 levels of info: Obscured (too far away), Field view (close), Field view plus hidden info (scouted) 
- Have some be ambushes where extra reinforcements spawn or another NPC shows up, etc
- Some squares might be corrupted and unviewable 
- Gambler ability, rolling a dud on the gamble mystery data table rolls again, but 3 duds in a row causes consequences

Player characters:
- Break (tyring to end the cycle)
	- Can end the run / cycle at multple points during the run, at which point they go to their true path
- Continue (trying to protect the cycle)
	- Can continue to a next playthrough after beating a run

NPCS:
- All NPCs should be merchants in some capacity
- Make all NPCs have an Other half / missing piece?
- Your other half (break if playing as continue or continue if playing as break) is a main obstacle
- Merchant
- Repairperson / Fixer (Healer)
- Really want a gambler (could be a sub-trait)
- Hunter (Treasure Hunter? Bounty Hunter? Maybe different between runs)
- Defender / Keeper (maybe opposite of Hunter)
